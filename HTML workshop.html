        Bleach (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series
        based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name. It was
        produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series
        aired on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366
        episodes. The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he
        obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to
        the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound
        powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil
        spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to
        adapting the manga series it is based on, the anime periodically
        includes original self-contained storylines and characters not found in
        the source material. Viz Media obtained foreign television and home
        video distribution rights to the Bleach anime in March 2006. Bleach was
        broadcast in the United States on Adult Swim from September 2006 to
        November 2014. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, a sequel series covering
        the manga's final story arc, also animated by Pierrot and directed by
        Tomohisa Taguchi, aired its first 13-episode cour on TV Tokyo from
        October to December 2022. The second cour premiered in July 2023..
